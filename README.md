# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques. The goal is to build predictive models and accurately forecast the house prices for the test set. The evaluation metric is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the predicted and actual prices.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Load the Datasets
We will use the following datasets for this project:

- **train.csv**: The training dataset containing house features and the target variable `SalePrice`.
- **test.csv**: The test dataset with house features, but without the `SalePrice`. We will predict `SalePrice` for these entries.
- **sample_submission.csv**: A template file for submission, containing columns `Id` and `SalePrice`.
- **data_description.txt**: A file that describes the features present in the dataset.

## Step 2: Check the Shape of the Datasets
Before analyzing the data, we check the shape (number of rows and columns) of both training and test datasets to understand their structure.

## Step 3: Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is essential for preparing the datasets for machine learning models. In this step, we will:

- **Check for missing values**: Identify features with missing data and decide on strategies to address them (e.g., imputation or removal).
- **Check for duplicates**: Remove duplicate entries that might skew results.
- **Handle outliers**: Detect and manage outliers that can distort model performance.
- **Data type consistency**: Ensure all features have the correct data type.
- **Remove irrelevant/skewed features**: Drop features that are not useful for prediction.

## Step 4: Handling Missing Values
We will address missing data by:

- **Dropping features** with more than 80% missing values (e.g., `PoolQC`, `MiscFeature`, `Alley`, `Fence`).
- **Imputing missing values**:
  - For **numerical features**: Fill with the median.
  - For **categorical features**: Fill with the mode (most frequent value).

## Step 5: Handling Remaining Missing Values in Test Dataset
We will recheck the test dataset and apply appropriate imputation strategies for any remaining missing values.

## Step 6: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps us understand the distribution of features and their relationship with the target variable. The key techniques we'll use include:

- **Correlation Heatmap**: Visualize the relationship between numerical features and the target variable (`SalePrice`).
- **Pair Plot**: Explore feature interactions and identify patterns or outliers.
- **t-SNE Visualization**: Use t-SNE to reduce dimensionality and visualize data clusters.
- **Stakeholder Visualizations**: Create bar plots or scatter plots for insights into how features influence house prices.

---

## Step 7: Feature Engineering
Feature engineering enhances model performance by:

- Creating new features from existing ones.
- Addressing multicollinearity using **LASSO Regression** (L1 regularization) and **ElasticNet Regression** (a combination of L1 and L2 regularization).
- Exploring transformations (e.g., scaling, logarithmic transformations) to improve model performance.

---

## Step 8: Model Training
We will build and train multiple models, including:

- **Linear Regression with Regularization**: Implementing LASSO and ElasticNet regression to reduce multicollinearity.
- **XGBoost with Parameter Tuning**: Optimizing hyperparameters for XGBoost to enhance performance.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining models using stacking techniques, including:
  - **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**
  - **XGBoost**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Neural Networks**

---

## Step 9: Model Evaluation
We will evaluate the models using the **RMSE** metric. Our goal is to minimize the RMSE between the predicted and actual sale prices.

---

## Step 10: Submission File
The final predictions will be submitted in the following format:

| Id  | SalePrice  |
| --- | ---------- |
| 1   | 123456.78  |
| 2   | 987654.32  |

## Goal
The main objective of this project is to predict the house prices (`SalePrice`) for the test dataset and submit predictions in the required format for the Kaggle competition.
